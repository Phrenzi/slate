# Introduction

Welcome to the Phrenzi API! You can use our API to access Phrenzi API endpoints, which can get
information on various establishments, transactions, and challenges in our database.

We have language bindings in Shell! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Phrenzi uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Phrenzi API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Phrenzi expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
